## Monolith

We're a group of teens working on creating a BCI PCB to start running our own experiments on noise filtering, signal processing speed, and data collection. Our board takes in electrode data from 8 electrodes, and outputs the data over SPI so that we can process it with a neural network.

## Setup

KiCad plugins that we highly suggest installing:

* [`espressif/kicad-libraries`](https://github.com/espressif/kicad-libraries): KiCad libraries for Espressif chips and modules
